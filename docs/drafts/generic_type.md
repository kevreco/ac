# Generic Types

The two following C expressions `int* int_pointer;` and `int int_values[10];`, can be written like those AC expressions `ptr(int)` and `array(int, 10)`.

This illustrates that C already handle generic types.

There must be a way to generalize the concept further on structs, enums and maybe typedefs.

@TODO this section needs to be expanded.
