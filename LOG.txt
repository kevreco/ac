If empty statements are allowed, then empty arguments should be allowed as well.
A simple warning should be issued. Treating warnings as errors should be also possible.

Example of empty statements:


{
   int value = 1;; // The second semi-colon is an empty statement.
   ; // This is an empty statement.
}

Example of empty arguments:

{
   function(a, , b); // second comma should just be skipped.
   function(a,  b,); // the last comma should also be ignored
}
